So the first little intro of the book goes through binary and simple search. So clearly. binary search is superior to simple search. It's just picking the middle of a set of numbers and doing a simple operation. This cuts the number of stuff in half that is being searched for during each iteration. It's faster and follows a logarithmic approach to the actual number instead of a linear single number step by step approach until you hit a "true". Binary search only works when lists are sorted. That's a trade off. It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to get the working version of a binary search python code file to work. But it works. The rest of the chapter goes over O(n) notation. Remember O(log n) < O(n) < O(n * log n) < O(n * n) O(n!)
It also covers the traveling salesman problem. The big takeaway is just that algorithms are wierd. You can't think about them like norma things, you have to think about their derivatives and how functions change from scenario to scenario.
