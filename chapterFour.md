Chapter Four talks about the divide and conquer methedologies along with the argument between average case and worst case. The chapter goes pretty far in depth into the Euclid's and Quicksort algorithms. One key takeaway from the chapter is the recursive case / base case problem solving theory. The idea that you can develop a recursive function and apply it to a function that can quickly converge on base case is extremely powerful. It only lacks in that it takes up a large amount of memory. However, again, it is easy to implement. We developed a quicksort algorithm, which was easy given the examples in the text. We went over average case and best case scenaios revolving around algorithmic speed. Overall a pretty productive chapter as far as concepts go.
