Chapter 6 was also mostly light. It went ove breadth first search. BFS is just an algorithm that tells us ift there is a pathway between two points in a graph. The chapter also went over nodes, edges, and how graphs function. Mostly just a refresher, but still useful none the less. BFS finds the shortest path between two points. The chapter also went over FIFO queues and LIFO stacks. A good strategy to use when looking over graphs where things may be connected from multiple angles is to mark an object as 'read' when it has already been checked. The chapter also went over primary, secondary, and tertiary connections.
