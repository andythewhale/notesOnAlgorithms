So in chapter 2 we discuss the concepts for how hardware processes information and storage. RAM and AM are covered along with arrays and linked lists. I knew all of the information but the text refreshes it in a very good way and I liked reading it. We discussed O(x) notation again. We also discussed sorting and timing with sorting algorithms. We went over how facebook stores data in an array / linked list format. Nothing truly amazing in this chapter. But still very refreshing and a great recap on core concepts.
