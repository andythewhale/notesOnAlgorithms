Chapter 3 was all about base cases and recursion. There were good examples that I had not thought of and it brought up the loop - recursion trade off. Recursion is a convenient way to write things. It is when the parent function and the child function are the same. This creates an incomplete function, executing the child function until it is complete then executing the parent function. This process is memory intensive. When optimizing algorithms loops must be used. But recusion is ok for quickly testing or doing tasks that are not memory intensive.
