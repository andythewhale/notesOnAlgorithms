So chapter 8 just went over greedy algorthms/ approximation algorithms. Which is good because we always need to be reminded of our options. These types of algorithms follow a rule that probably leads to a local "good enough" algorithm opposed to a global optimum. The goal is for the algorithm to be fast enough and smart enough to get a good enough solution. The chapter talked about NP-Complete problems. NP-Complete problems are easy, they're just not efficient to find solutions to. Calculations take forever using a computer. Approximation algorithms find productive ways to solve for the solutions.
