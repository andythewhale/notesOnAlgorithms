Chapter 7 talked about weighted graphs and gave me an introduction to searching weighted graphs. It was very good. Dijkstra's is very cool but it has little application to deep learning. However it is nice to learn about the nuances of sorting weights and creating a table that assigns scores and weights to different pathways. The concepts presented in the chapter are extremely important. Dijkstra's algorithm works by searching a graph and assigning weights for the cheapest aggregate pathway to each node. This way Dijkstra can assign the cheapest cost path from A --> B.
It does this by making and storing a table of the cost to each point and the parent/child nodes.
